This is a simple Instagram connector that connects to and queries the Instagram Basic Display API. The following actions are supported:
1. Get information about the owner of the access_token.
2. Get the most recent media published by the owner of the access_token.
3. Get a list of recent comments on your media object.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This connector requires any Node version between 4.x.x and 8 .14.
Note: If you have installed any other Node version on your system, you can:
1. Use tools to switch between different versions of Node

  b. For Mac, use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
2. Build your app using your existing Node version and then transpile your code using a transpiler like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
